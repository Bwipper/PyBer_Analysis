# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project is to create a DataFrame that contains ride sharing details by city type and then analyze those results. We tracked urban. suburban, and rural ride sharing data for this project. The results should be able to help the company that uses this data to determine how to better market their services.
## Results
Overall reults that the data showed us is:

Rides: The majority of rides occurred in the Urban cities.
Drivers: The majority of drivers are in the Urban cities
Total Fares: The most fares were produced in the Urban cities.
Average Fare per Ride: The highest average fare per ride was in the Rural areas.
Average Fare per Driver: The highest average fare per driver are in Rural areas.

## Summary

Urban Average Fare per Driver Improvements:
The data shows that ride shares Urban areas is good but can be even better by utilizing the data we reviwed. It seems like there are almost 1/3 more drivers than there are passengers on average. If the excess amount of drivers is removed, the overall profits for the drivers being utilzed will be greater.

Rural Average Fare per Ride:
The average fare per ride for the rural areas is high but this is most likely due to the fact that there is typically greater distances to travel in rural areas. This leads to longer travel time and thus, larger fees for the passengers. More drivers could be hired in the rural areas but im not sure if this would actually help because distance is distance and hiring more people doesnt take miles off the map.
